# RNAssignment for 99XT

<br />

### Simple React Native app for the initial screening. 
For this simple app, it is not necessarily have to use redux, redux saga or realm (Can do easily with asynStoarge). Since this is the screening interview process, I thought it would be better to add those latest technologies.
